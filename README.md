An anki addon that shows some confetti when you've finished a deck ðŸ˜Š

<b>Credits</b>
<ul>
  <li>The main content of this addon (the confetti) was <b>not written by me</b> - that fantastic functionality is all thanks to loonywizard (https://github.com/loonywizard). All this addon does is call that confetti code in the right place on the overview screen!</li>
  <li>The idea for this addon is thanks to a med school friend of mine, who thought of this fun addition to make studying with Anki a little more fun.</li>
